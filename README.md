I did these projects during my studies.

You'll find a CSS-Generator: PHP script turning a folder including pngs into a sprite and the associate css file ready to use.
type this in your CLI to use it:
./css_generator (options) <folderpath>

The options are : 
1. -i <filename> : rename the default sprite.png
2. -s <filename> : rename the default style.css
3. -r : reccursively get all the pngs in the subfolders

The Puissance4 folder contains a 4 in a row game that you can customize passing other arguments to the constructor
